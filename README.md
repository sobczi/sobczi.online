Repository of the frontend work.

Beside of hosting my CV also I'm using this app to create and manage my invoices, pomodoro (WIP) and basic management of users.

## :hammer: TODO's
- :alarm_clock: Pomodoro app full integration with FE && BE with :bell: push notifications,
- :boom: Removing current functionality of registering accounts and activating them as demo users. Instead allow easy switching to demo user app preview with mock interceptors,
- :unlock: publish backend repository,
- :email: Sending backup of invoices; guarding them with private keys,
- :notebook: Preview of invoices,
- :dollar: Payment of invoices, marking particural invoices as already paid,
- :email: Email confirmation for new accounts,
- :question: Switching to monorepo and sharing DTO's,
- :computer: Frontend in :heavy_check_mark: Angular && :heavy_multiplication_x: Vue && :heavy_multiplication_x: React - easy switching between frameworks.
